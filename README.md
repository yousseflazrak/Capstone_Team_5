## Making Trading Decision with Machine Learning
This project works on optimizing liquidation strategy with reinforcement learning.

Currently, we are simulating the market environment with the Almgren-Chriss model and trying to explore the implementation of trading strategies.

Specifically, we are doing the following work:

1. Trying to implement the closed form solution under single agent settings
2. Using reinforcement techniques to train a single agent and compare its trading trajectory to the closed form one
3. Moving on to multi-agent settings and trying to explore the relationships between different agents
